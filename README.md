# Integral Solutions - Homework 5

The goal of this exercise was to implement a Python package for sorting integer 
lists using the DevOps software development approach.

## Outline of Tasks
We needed to:
1. Implement the algorithms for bubble, quick and insertion sort where code was documented using
standard Python practices, (see [docstring 
styles](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3898572/what-is-the-standard-python-docstring-format))
2. Implement testing using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) framework.
3. Implement linting and style checking using both [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and 
[black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 
4. Modify the GitHub actions workflow so that it tested and built the package for all 
three operating systems (OSX/Linux/Win) and for Python versions 3.6 and 3.9.
5. Modify this file to describe this repository and the DevOps workflow you 
implemented (see below for the workflow badge).
